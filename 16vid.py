# Homework
# 1.Greet Function: Write a function greet() that takes no arguments and prints a greeting message.
# def greet():
#     print("Good morning!!")
# greet()

# 2.Parameterized Greet: Write a function greet_user() that takes a name as input 
# and prints a custom greeting.
# def greet_user(user):
#     print(f"Good morning {user}!!")
# greet_user("Gowda")

# 3.Sum Function: Write a function add_numbers(a, b) that returns the sum of two numbers. 
# Call this function with different values.
# def add_numbers(a, b):
#     print(f"The sum of {a} and {b} is {a+b}")
# add_numbers(3,4)
# add_numbers(2,3)
