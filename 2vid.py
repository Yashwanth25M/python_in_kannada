# variables
# variable values can be changed
# initiatialization of variable a = 10
# a = 10
# b = 10
# a = b = 10 #is same as a=10 b=10
# a , b , c = 1 , 2 , 3 #"is same as a=1 , b=2 , c=3"

# variable naming rules
# variables can only contain alphabet , number ,underscore and should not use special characters
# should not start with numbers ,but only start with underscore(_) or alphabet
# variables names are case sensitive ("Name" is not equal to "name")

# type checking
# different datatypes are int(10,2) , float(10.2,3.14) , char(string) , bool(True,False) , none(a datatype that holds none datatype)
#print(a.type())  " to find type of datatype"

# type conversion
# a = 10 "int type"
# b = float( a ) "converted int to float type " 


# arithmetic operators(addition (+) , subtraction(-), Multiplication(*),Exponential(**),Division(/),float division(//) ,Modulus(%))
# a = 100
# b = 20
# print(a+b) #"performing a addition(a and b is operands where + is operator)"
# print(a-b)
# print(a*b)
# print(a/b)
# print(a//b) # float division performs round-off
# print(a**b) #exponential that 10 ^ 20
# #arithmetic operations follows BODMAS rule










# HW
#   question 1 :  Arithmetic Practice: Write a Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations 
# (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers. Define the two 
# numbers as variables within the code and print the results for each operation.
# Answer
# a = 100
# b = 20
# print(a+b) #"performing a addition(a and b is operands where + is operator)"
# print(a-b)
# print(a*b)
# print(a/b)
# print(a//b) # float division performs round-off
# print(a**b) #exponential that 10 ^ 20
# #arithmetic operations follows BODMAS rule





# question 2 : . Swap Two Variables: Write a Python program that swaps the values of two variables with 
# and without using a third variable.
# Answer

#  swaping of two numbers
# a = 1
# b = 2
# print ("Before swapping")
# print(f" the value of a is {a} , value of b is {b}")
# # swapping begins
# temp = a
# a = b
# b = temp
# print ("After swapping")
# print(f" the value of a is {a} , value of b is {b}")

# This swaps two numbers
